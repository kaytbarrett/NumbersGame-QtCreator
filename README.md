<h2>This is a Numbers Guessing Game (called Bulls and Cows)</h2>
<p>Although the problem did not originally include a the requirement of a GUI, I wanted to practice using QtCreator and created a very simple GUI 
to go along with this game.</p>

<h5>Prompt from PPP Chapter 4:</h5>
<p>Implement a little guessing game called (for some obscure reason) "Bulls and Cows." The program has a vector of four different 
  integers in the range 0 - 9 (e.g. 1234 but not 1122) and it is the user's task to discover those numbers by repeated guesses. 
  Say the number to be guessed is 1234 and the user guesses 1359, the response should be "1 bull and 1 cow" because the user got 
  one digit (1) in the right position (a bull) and one digit (3) right but in the wrong position (a cow). The guessing continues 
  until the user gets four bulls, aka the user gets the four digits in the correct order.</p>
